# Software-development-for-algorithmic-problems
The project we had in this course. 

We implemented a programme which could find the solutions of two functions with two variables of any given power.
More specifically. At first we were asked to implement a number of matrices with specific properties so through them
and the help from linear algebra we could find the solutions of the functions, if there were any. After we made and UI for
the programme using Qt creator. At the UI the user could click points in a given Cartesian coordinate system and the
programme would be able to calculate the function which passes from all the given points. After the user gave two
function, either by clicking points or by writing the function the programme would draw the two functions and mark the
places where they crossed, if there were any, so the user could see the solution of the functions.
